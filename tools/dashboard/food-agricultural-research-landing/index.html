                <p>The Food and Agricultural Research Dashboard provides new information about how food and agricultural research data are used in scientific research. The search process, described in more detail in the 2024 Harvard Science Review special issue and the Technical Report, identifies mentions of datasets in publications, to find what authors from which institutions have studied what research areas using each dataset. This information can be used by researchers to find other experts to build a common community of practice, by data producers to make their data more visible and usable, and by the public to get a better sense of how research data have been used.</p>
                <p>This is a beta version.  More  food and agricultural research datasets could readily be added as the community identifies datasets of interest. Improved search tools could also be developed.</p>

            <h4>About This Beta Dashboard</h4>
            <p><strong>Beta Version Notice:</strong> This is a beta version of the Food And Agricultural Research Dashboard. We are actively working on validating the collected metadata and improving our data analysis methods. The results shown should be considered preliminary as we continue to refine our approach.</p>
            <p>The Food And Agricultural Research Dashboard is part of the Democratizing Data Initiative's effort to enable different communities to understand how government data assets are used. The dashboard draws from a database that describes how Food And Agricultural Research data assets are referenced in research publications, linking mentions with research topics, authors, and their affiliated institutions.</p>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> This pilot project reflects information associated with datasets specifically requested for analysis and is not intended to capture all references to all Food And Agricultural Research datasets. As this is a beta version, we are continuously working to validate and improve the accuracy of our metadata collection and analysis processes. The project continues through America's Datahub Consortium.</p>
