    heading: "Ways to democratize data"
    description: "The goal is to develop a community of practice through workshops, webinars, and direct engagement with the user community. The user community built the initial models through <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/coleridgeinitiative-show-us-the-data\" target=\"_blank\">a Kaggle</a> competition; a <a href=\"https://coleridgeinitiative.org/show-us-the-data-conference\" target=\"_blank\">Show Us the Data</a> conference brought together researchers, academic institutions, chief data officers, and publishers; subsequent conferences have built on the ideas. More are planned."
