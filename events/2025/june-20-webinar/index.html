                <h2>About This Webinar</h2>
                <p>This webinar will focus on how to respond to the changing data landscape that is likely to affect food and agricultural research. Trusted data on food and agriculture are essential for high quality research and decision-making. Our current ecosystem has been shaken by the removal of important, trusted, public datasets and web-based tools used by decision makers. This fragility has introduced uncertainty for the food and agricultural research community whose work is foundational to expanding economic opportunities, ensuring agricultural sustainability, and protecting natural resources. New approaches must be developed.</p>

                <h3>Webinar Agenda</h3>
                <p>The webinar will feature presentations and new ideas from national experts who are working to build trusted data infrastructures.</p>

                <div class="card--plain">
                    <h4>Featured Speakers</h4>
                    <ul>

                <h4>Key Questions</h4>
                <p>The presentations in this webinar session will address the following questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What could the role of the user community be in users defining whether specific food and agricultural research data are trustworthy?</li>
                    <li>How can future data infrastructure better reflect community assessments of data quality?</li>
                </ul>

                    <h4>Understanding Trusted Data</h4>
                    <p>The challenge is that "trusted data" need to reflect more than the way the data are produced, they need to be data that are fit for purpose. Data are trusted when they can be used to answer a specific question or support a decision with confidence. This includes not only being timely, accessible, appropriately detailed, but also relevant to the context in which they're used. The webinar will discuss what trusted data means in practice, and how we can work together to build data systems that are resilient, responsive, and rooted in the needs of their users.</p>
